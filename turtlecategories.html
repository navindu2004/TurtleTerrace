<h2>Categories of turtles in Sri Lanka</h2>

        <h3>1. Green Sea Turtles</h3>
      <p>Green turtles are the most popular turtles and also one of the largest sea turtles in Sri Lanka. They are herbivores that live in shallow waters near the shore. Tropical and subtropical waters are the principal habitats for green turtles. They travel great distances, like other sea turtles, to get to their home beaches and feeding places. The overharvesting of their eggs, adult turtle hunting, getting trapped in fishing gear, and loss of nesting beaches are threats to green turtles, which are the reasons why they are listed as endangered by the WWF.</p>

        <h3>2. Loggerhead Turtle</h3>
      <p>This species of turtle typically live in deeper waters. The enormous heads of loggerhead turtles reinforce strong jaw muscles that enable them to bite through hard-shelled prey like clams and sea urchins, hence the name of the species. Because loggerhead turtles commonly interact with fisheries, or the unintentional capture of marine animals in fishing gear, is a significant issue for them.  In addition to this, the only surviving members of the group of reptiles (other than crocodiles) that have roamed our oceans for the past 100 million years are Loggerhead turtles. Development of the tourism industry has put many of their nesting beaches in danger. The most prominent type of turtle in the Mediterranean is the loggerhead, which breeds on beaches from Greece and Turkey to Israel and Libya</p>

        <h3>3. Hawksbill Turtle</h3>
        <p>Hawksbill turtles are the most endangered species in Sri Lanka. They are renowned for their distinctive shell design and capacity to consume poisonous sponges. The word "hawksbill" refers to a bird's short, pointed beak. On their shells, they have a peculiar pattern of interlocking scales that give the edges a serrated appearance. Due to their unique colors and patterns, their shells are quite precious and frequently referred to as "tortoiseshell" in marketplaces.</p>
        <p>Hawksbills are primarily found in coral reefs in the tropical oceans of the world. They mostly eat sponges, which they pull from reef crevices using their tiny, pointed beaks, although they also consume sea anemones and jellyfish. </p>

        <h3>4. Olive Ridley Sea Turtle</h3>
      <p>In Sri Lanka, Olive Ridley turtles are the smallest species of marine turtle. Typically, they can be encountered in great numbers during the breeding season.. This sea turtle's name is related to the shade of olive green that may be seen on its shell. Of all sea turtles, they are currently among the most common. Due to the fact that they only nest in a few number of locations, any disruption to even one nest beach might have a significant impact on the population as a whole.</p>

            <h3>5. Leatherback Turtles</h3>
          <p>Leatherback turtles are the biggest and most migratory species of marine turtles found in Sri Lanka. The name "leatherback" refers to the leather-like, as opposed to a hard, like other turtles' shell, that this species of turtle has.</p>
          <p>Every summer and fall, Pacific leatherbacks travel from their habitats in the area known as the Coral Triangle all the way to the Hikkaduwa coast to dine on the profusion of jellyfish.</p>
         <p>The number of leatherback turtles has drastically decreased over the past century due to substantial egg collection in fisheries. Although the IUCN lists the leatherback as Vulnerable globally, specific populations (such as those in the Pacific and Southwest Atlantic) are Critically Endangered.</p>
