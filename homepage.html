                    <p>Sri Lanka is home to various species of marine animals such as sea turtles, and the nation's coastline serves a tremendous role in providing a suitable habitat and ecosystem for the turtles to live in. Most of the beaches in Sri Lanka are nesting grounds for sea turtles, for them to protect their hatchlings, making them one of the most important sites for the growth and survival of turtle populations. Due to many climactic events such as pollution and human interference over the course of the recent years, it has proven to be detrimental towards the sea-turtle species. According to a study done by the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Sri Lanka is home to five species of endangered sea turtles, many of which are threatened by mainly habitat loss, poaching and pollution.</p>
                    <p> Due to the threat the turtles face on a daily basis, we at Turtle Terrace Hikkaduwa have made it our main vision and mission to help protect and rehabilitate at-risk sea turtles, while also promoting education and awareness of their importance to the ecosystem and local communities in Sri lanka. At Turtle Terrace Hikkaduwa, you will be able to experience the significance of turtles in the marine eco-system, as well as the various species of turtles in the Hikkaduwa area. We strive to provide a safe haven for injured or sick turtles, nourish them back to health and release them back to their habitat. Our team of marine specialists and volunteers work tirelessly to guarantee the turtles get the utmost care and to nurture them until they are fit to be released into the wild back again. </p><br>
